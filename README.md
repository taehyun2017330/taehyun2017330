I'm deeply passionate about creating meaningful interactions between humans and computers. My academic journey in **Computer Science and Engineering** has given me interest for **Data Visualization** and **Machine Learning**. Currently, I am diving into research that innovates ways for users to harness the power of unsupervised learning techniques like dimensionality reduction or clustering. I am always eager to collaborate, learn, and grow, aspiring to make my own modest contribution towards the shoulders of giants.💡
